# Covid-19-EDA

In this project we will be working on COVID-19 Dataset which was generated during COVID-19 pandemic. In this project we will be doing Exploratory Data Analysis of the Dataset. As a Data Analyst I will try to find the insights and see each and every feature and try to find the best possible insights from the same.

I will try to visualize each and every feature in best possible way to understand the data in more easy way.
